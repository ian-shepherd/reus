## Soccer/Football Team Information

This package is designed to extract match statistics and league information from fbref in addition to player and team information from transfermarkt. Specific shoutout to [worldfootballR](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR) and their associated [dataset](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data) that provided the inspiration to build the python version.
